    	(5, 'FAQ', 'faq', '<div class=\"prepend-4 span-16 last\">\r\n<h2>FAQ</h2>\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>Which shows do you include?</strong><br />\r\nWe include any live theatrical performance in New York City that has at least five reviews from our trusted sources.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<strong>Which reviewers do you include?</strong><br />\r\nWe include as many thoughtful published critics as we can. We look for writers who express clear and informed opinions. While many of our sources are well known publications like The New York Times, Time Out, and Variety, we\'re proud to have discovered many other lesser-known but valuable voices to add to the conversation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<strong>What do the grades mean?</strong><br />\r\nWe carefully read each review to analyze how the reviewer felt about a given show. We make every effort to keep our grades consistent from show to show and from review to review. Please see our <a href=\"/grading.html\">Grading Guide</a> for details.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<strong>How do you calculate the overall grade of the show?</strong><br />\r\nThe overall grade for a show is determined by calculating the median grade of all graded reviews.  The median is the exact middle of a set of grades.  For example: if a show receives reviews with the grades A-, A-, B+, B+, B, C-, and C-, the median would be a B+; or if a show receives five As and one F, the median score would be an A.  We use medians rather than averages because it more accurately reflects the critical consensus, rather than simply the average of what critics thought.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<strong>What happens when a publication uses its own star rating or grading system?</strong><br />\r\nWe take them under advisement, but we do not let them determine the grades on StageGrade. Stars and grades within a publication are not always assigned by the reviewers themselves; they are sometimes assigned by editors. Furthermore, star ratings are not consistent from publication to publication or writer to writer. By using our own process consistently, we keep the grades standardized.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<strong>The grade changed!  Why?</strong><br />\r\nShows go live on StageGrade as soon as they receive five reviews. Often, weekly publications such as The New Yorker and Time Out New York do not weigh in on a show until later in the week. We fold in new reviews as they arrive. Sometimes this changes a showâ€™s overall median grade. Also, sometimes existing individual grades of reviews may change when we are asked to reconsider them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<strong>What if I disagree with a grade?</strong><br />\r\nWe are happy to review any grade that you disagree with; simply <a href=\"mailto:contact@stagegrade.com\">send us an e-mail</a>.  Please note that we may decide to keep the grade the way it is.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<strong>What if I found a review that I think should be included?</strong><br />\r\nBy all means, <a href=\"mailto:contact@stagegrade.com\">send it to us</a>!  Ultimately, inclusion of reviews is at the discretion of the StageGrade editorial staff.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<strong>What if I never agree with a particular critic? Can I see an adjusted grade based on my specific taste?</strong></br />\r\nWe will soon add features that let you to submit your own grades and reviews, keep track of which reviewers you trust, and receive personalized recommendations.  If you\'d like to be kept in the know, please <a href=\"/users/new\">create a free StageGrade account!</a><br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<strong>The show I\'m looking for isn\'t listed.  Where is it?</strong><br />\r\nIt may not have opened yet, it may not have five reviews, or it may have already closed.  Try our search tool at the top of the page.
